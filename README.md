  ## Instillation
  If a user wanted to install the dependencies required for this application, they would need to run the command "npm install" at the root directory of th eapplication. The dependecies that are required for this application are: React, Reactstrap, Bootstrap, Bootstrap-Icons, Validator, Framer-Motion, SweetAlert2, and EmailJS.

  ## Usage
  The primary function of this application is to be a professional portfolio. Fellow developers could also use this application as an example of an SPA created with React.

  ## Functionality
  This application functions by conditionally rendering React components based on the navigation tab selected. There are four pages within this application: About, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact, each with their own React Component. There are also React components for the Navigation, Footer, and Projects (listed in the Portfolio component).
  The application uses ReactStrap for the vast majority of HTML elements.
  The About component renders when the "About" navigation tab is selected. The corresponding page looks like the following:
